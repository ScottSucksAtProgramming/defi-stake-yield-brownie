# Solidity Learning Project: Token Farm

## Description

This is a set of SmartContracts written in Solidity which simulate a yield farm with stakeing. Once deployed users can stake specified tokens into the contract and receive rewards based on the value of their staked tokens. The tokens staked within this simulation are not used for anything. This code is my version of the code available from the [Solidity, Blockchain and Smart Contract Course - Beginner to Expert Python Tutorial](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-py) created by Patrick Collins.
